When would the use of generators be preferred over list comprehension and vice versa?

- You would want to use a generator when resources are your main concern. Generators use a lot less memory compared to generators,
  but are much slower.

- You would want to use list comprehension if speed is your main concern. List comprehension is faster than generators,
  but uses more memory.
